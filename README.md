## Problem Statement

There are three different datasets the classification needs to be performed on: [Yelp Review Full](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yelp_review_full), [dbpedia 14](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dbpedia_14), [Amazon polarity](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amazon_polarity), which are of the form: content, title, and class. The models to be used are:

- Baseline
  - BoW
  - BoW with TF-IDF
  - LSTM
- Character Level Models
  - Character Level Convolution Network
  - CANINE
